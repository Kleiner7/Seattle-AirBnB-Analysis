### Tools

Tableau - Data visualization, data analysis, creating reports

### Exploratory Data Analysis 

Explored Airbnb listings data to answer key questions, such as:

- How do the listing prices change based on the area?
- What are the ideal months to rent out a property on Airbnb if the owner would like to live there part time?
- How do the number of bedrooms impact the price of the listing?
- Which number of bedrooms performs the best on Airbnb?
- What is the market like in terms of the number of listings based on the number of bedrooms?

### Insights/Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
- The areas of Seattle that have the highest listing prices are the zipcodes 98134, 98119, 98101, 98109, and 98121, all of which are located central
- One-bedroom listings are the least expensive listings for both short-term and long-term rentals. Yet overall, one-bedroom listings make the most money, with the total revenue being $63,612,925.
- If the owner would like to live at this property part-time, it would be best to live there early in the year and then rent out the listing on Airbnb during the summer months, starting around May. It would be wise to continue this into the winter, as there is a peak in revenue around December.
- 6 bedroom listings are priced over 6 times higher than 1 bedrooms, yet there are significantly fewer 6 bedroom listings in the Seattle area.
